# Brain Index

Use this index as Question -> Knowledge Needed -> File. Do not search the whole brain when a mapped source exists.

## Context levels

1. **Minimal:** `AI_BRAIN.md`, this index, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, latest handoff.
2. **Current work:** today's log, task specification, directly relevant source files.
3. **Supporting knowledge:** the exact architecture, contract, decision, or operations file needed.
4. **Historical:** older logs, archived handoffs, and legacy progress only when the answer cannot be found above.

Record significant new facts with their source. Promote durable decisions to `decisions/`; leave transient debugging detail in daily logs.
